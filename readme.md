# Quote Keeper Feature Level

should allow users to enter the following information about each quote they would like to save to the app:

- The quote itself
- Who the quote is attributed to
- The source of the quote:
    - Book
    - Article
    - Speech
    - IRL

For permission errors use `chmod a+x bin/wdio-test`

## Server Level Tests

write server tests for the application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes.

The scope of our test is that a user should be able to submit a quote and have it displayed back to the user upon submission.

test to drive the development of the Quote model with the red, green, refactor cycle, 
set up a database and define a model using MongoDB, Nodeâ€™s Mongoose package, and the Chai assertion module.

## SETUP

```bash
> npm install
> npm start
> npm test
```
